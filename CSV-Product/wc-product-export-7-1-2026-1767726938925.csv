For example, your gut microbiome is comprised of bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that contribute to nutrient absorption, digestion, and directly impact your overall health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<i>What is a desiccant-lined bottle and why is it important?</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA desiccant is a material that absorbs moisture. ProBioCare products have a desiccant-lined bottle to protect the probiotics from exposure to heat, light, and moisture, which can result in degradation and potency reduction. This also eliminates the need for refrigeration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n</div>\n<div class=""directions col-xs-12 col-sm-12 my-24"">\n<h3 class=""lbl-heading"">Directions</h3>\n<div class=""slugContent"">Take one (1) vegetable capsule daily, preferably in between meals.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=""directions col-xs-12 col-sm-12"">\n<h3 class=""lbl-heading"">Warning</h3>\nStore in a cool, dry place.
